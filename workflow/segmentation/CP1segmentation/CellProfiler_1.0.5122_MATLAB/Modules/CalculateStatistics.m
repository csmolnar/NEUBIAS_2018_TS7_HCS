% Help for the Calculate Statistics module:
% Category: Measurement
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Calculates measures of assay quality (V and Z' factors) and dose response
% data (EC50) for all measured features made from images.
% *************************************************************************
%
% The V and Z' factors are statistical measures of assay quality and are
% calculated for each per-cell and per-image measurement that you have made
% in the pipeline. For example, the Z' factor indicates how well-separated
% the positive and negative controls are. Calculating these values by
% placing this module at the end of a pipeline allows you to choose which
% measured features are most powerful for distinguishing positive and
% negative control samples, or for accurately quantifying the assay's
% response to dose. Both Z' and V factors will be calculated for all
% measured values (Intensity, AreaShape, Texture, etc.). These measurements
% can be exported as the "Experiment" set of data.
%
% For both Z' and V factors, the highest possible value (best assay
% quality) = 1 and they can range into negative values (for assays where
% distinguishing between positive and negative controls is difficult or
% impossible). A Z' factor > 0 is potentially screenable; A Z' factor > 0.5
% is considered an excellent assay.
%
% The Z' factor is based only on positive and negative controls. The V
% factor is based on an entire dose-response curve rather than on the
% minimum and maximum responses. When there are only two doses in the assay
% (positive and negative controls only), the V factor will equal the Z'
% factor.
%
% Note that if the standard deviation of a measured feature is zero for a
% particular set of samples (e.g. all the positive controls), the Z' and V
% factors will equal 1 despite the fact that this is not a useful feature
% for the assay. This occurs when you have only one sample at each dose.
% This also occurs for some non-informative measured features, like the
% number of Cytoplasm compartments per Cell which is always equal to 1.
%
% Features measured:   Feature Number:
% Zfactor            |      1
% Vfactor            |      2
% EC50               |      3
%
%
% You must load a simple text file with one entry per cycle (using the Load
% Text module) that tells this module either which samples are positive and
% negative controls, or the concentrations of the sample-perturbing reagent
% (e.g., drug dosage). This text file would look something like this:
%
% [For the case where you have only positive or negative controls; in this
% example the first three images are negative controls and the last three
% are positive controls. They need not be labeled 0 and 1; the calculation
% is based on whichever samples have minimum and maximum dose, so it would
% work just as well to use -1 and 1, or indeed any pair of values:]
% DESCRIPTION Doses
% 0

% (Note that in this example, the Z' and V factors will be meaningless because
% there is only one sample at the each dose, so the standard deviation of
% measured features at each dose will be zero).

% exponential notation:]
