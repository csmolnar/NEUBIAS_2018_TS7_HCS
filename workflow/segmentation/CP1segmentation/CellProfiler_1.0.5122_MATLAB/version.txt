 - Added help menu for Modules
 - Several various bug fixes

Version 1.0.3544
 - Added new help section "Getting Started"
 - Added help on Batch Processing
 - CreateBatchScripts is now CreateBatchFiles
 - CreateBatchFiles can produce files for CPCluster, which allows users to do cluster analysis without MatLab licenses
 - WriteSQLFiles is now ExportToDatabase
 - ExportToDatabase can export SQL files for MySQL and Oracle
 - ShowDataOnImage can now show text labels added with LoadText or AddData

Modules where you may notice this change: CorrectIllumination_Calculate, CPSmooth, IdentifyPrimAutomatic, and FindEdges.
 - CPSmooth speed optimization.
 - Fixed */.mat bug when selecting or saving a pipeline.
 - Normalized Zernike measurements by area.
